Big companies require strict project management on the features added in their repository and there has to be a system with varied user access control with multi-tiered access for different types of users.

Large project require through planning and the administrators need to keep a close check on what all is developed. This project allows the administrator to approve or reject the different features proposed by the users.

This project is required because the teams can be cross country or across different countries and in large companies there has to be a system for easy communication on the project apart from just normal communication channels. This project provides a context based communication channel, emails or slack don’t suffice as it’s easy to loose track of what project is being talked about and it’s hard to search and recap what was discussed.

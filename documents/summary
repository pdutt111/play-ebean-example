This project aims to develop a web-based project management system to help the decision maker to verify the projects and approve features.
The system allows users to create projects and send them for verification by the administrator.

The system is useful for project management in big companies as they require strict approval processes. This system is is completely cloud based and follows service oriented protocols.

The system has two types of users - regular users and administrator, the regular users can add features or projects and the administrator is charged with approving the project or to reject the project.

All the requirements have been met by this decision-making system. And all known bugs and issues have been fixed.

Since our team has only two members, we are required to finish the 40 percent of the whole 14 required features, i.e., 6 features. For the completed logic of our project, we have done 6 completed features and 3 partial features in total, which are feature 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, and part of feature 6, 7, 8. And we are not required to have user group related functions.

We have separate our system into a front-end project and a back-end project, so that we can run them in different ports.
